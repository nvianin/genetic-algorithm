* Activate function to interact with the mouse
* Build and insert methods on the QuadTree

UUIDs instead of indicies for agents
AgentType specific quadtrees for cases where agent number varies greatly ?
  -> need for reliable benchmarking chronometer

Performance comparison w/ mouse querying : red = js, green = wasm, toggle with mouseclick ? 

Implement full-on debug mode, away from 3d rendering 
   -> 3d/debug switch at the top ? 
      -> aggressive context switching with pause mechanics needed for 3d
