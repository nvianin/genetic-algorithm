- Activate function to interact with the mouse
- Build and insert methods on the QuadTree

---

UUIDs instead of indicies for agents
-> store id inside agent
Use hashmap for agent store, have max number of each agent type, extend hashmap by like 500 each time so reallocation is not oo tfrequent.
AgentType specific quadtrees for cases where agent number varies greatly ?
-> need for reliable benchmarking chronometer

Performance comparison w/ mouse querying : red = js, green = wasm, toggle with mouseclick ?

Implement full-on debug mode, away from 3d rendering
-> 3d/debug switch at the top ?
-> aggressive context switching with pause mechanics needed for 3d

Implement statistical analysis
-> getters for medians/average
-> js graph drawing each x ms
-> interface to change visualization

Implement genotypes to evolve / crossbreed / mutate

## Genotype variables:

Size : Influences Speed and Gestation Duration
Sight : Influences environmental awareness (food, predators)
Muscle Mass : Influences Speed and Hunger Rate

## Genotype derived variables:

Gestation Duration
Speed
Hunger Rate

Put a green circle around agent you're hovering/last selected agent
-> make it a circle with a radius of 1.5 _ agent size
-> make it a circle with a radius of 1.5 _ agent sight

Put a texture on the ground

Displace the ground to make it look like a hill with a river

Handle agent death

Implement a "pause" button
-> implement a "step" button
-> implement a "reset" button

Implement a speed slider

Handle boundary crossing
